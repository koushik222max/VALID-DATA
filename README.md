🔢 Beautiful Numbers – Input Validator
🎯 Hook

100% clean data before your code even starts the party.

📜 Body

This Python script keeps asking the user for numbers until they:

Are integers only (no strings, no floats)

Fall between 0 and 10 (inclusive)

Are separated by commas for easy parsing

If the input doesn’t match the rules, it explains why and asks again — ensuring only “beautiful” numbers make it through.

Example:

Enter the numbers separated by numbers: 2,5,9
The numbers are beautiful

🚀 CTA

Try it, break it, feed it weird inputs — it will still guide you back to perfection.
